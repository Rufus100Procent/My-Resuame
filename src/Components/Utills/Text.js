    PROJECT_1: "During the summer, I worked on my own project, a Music Application, where I used Java, Spring Boot, JPA, JDBC, PostgreSQL (in a Docker container), and frontend technologies (JS/HTML/CSS). The application allows users to upload their own MP3 files and provide details such as song name, artist, album, genre, and year. All this information is stored in a PostgreSQL database, and the backend manages saving the MP3 files in local storage while sending the file path and metadata to the database. I implemented several validations to avoid duplication and ensure correct MP3 files.   In this project, I learned a lot more about Spring Boot and JPA. The most challenging part for me was the frontend aspect   because I had limited knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS, which required me to invest more time in improving my skills in this area.    During the project, I used Trello to set goals and achieve them.",
    PROJECT_2:
      "In this project, I developed a Spring Boot file hosting application and started with Test-Driven Development (TDD). Once the application was ready, I pushed the code and Docker image to AWS CodeCommit/ECR. I then configured AWS CodeBuild, an ECS   Cluster, and CodePipeline to perform a deployment on EC2. The project was conducted following the Scrum methodology to    streamline the process. In this project, I learned about Scrum, AWS Development tools, and ECR.",
    SUMMER_JOBB: "My tasks included documenting, posting images on social media platforms such as Facebook, editing short videos, and interviewing visitors at Skultuna. I was one of four people, and we interviewed more than 120 individuals.",
